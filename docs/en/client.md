# Client Modules and Systems

The client is a browser app built on PixiJS (Vite build, Pug templates in
[packages/engine/src/client/views/](../../packages/engine/src/client/views/)). The entry point is
[packages/engine/src/client/main.js](../../packages/engine/src/client/main.js).

## main.js — bootstrap, dispatcher, and render loop

- **Bootstrap**: before anything else, fetches the master's game catalog
  (`GET /games/manifest.json`, `GameCatalog` — see [master.md](master.md))
  and dynamically loads the active game's `ClientPlugin` by its manifest's
  `entries.client` (`packages/engine/src/lib/gamePlugin.js`,
  `loadClientPlugin`), rejecting a mismatched `engineApi`. With one game in
  the catalog, the first manifest entry is used and the lobby's game picker
  stays hidden (see [plugin-api.md](plugin-api.md)). It also brings up the
  **LobbyAuth** login gate independently of the signaling socket (see below)
  and connects `SignalingClient`. The lobby (`initLobby`) opens only once
  both `welcome` (from the master) and `authenticated` (from LobbyAuth) have
  fired — `#lobby` stays hidden until the player is signed in. Picking a
  server → `connectToHost` creates a `WebRtcManager`, establishes P2P, and
  remembers `currentHostId` (for `/like`·`/unlike`).
- **Server rating (`/like`·`/unlike`)**: outgoing chat goes through
  `handleChatSend` — it intercepts `/like <reason>`/`/unlike <reason>` and,
  instead of sending it to the host (port `CHAT_DATA`), sends the vote
  straight to the master (`signaling.likeHost`/`unlikeHost(currentHostId,
  reason, token)`, `token` — the voter's identity-token from `LobbyAuth`),
  bypassing the cheating host. A reason is required, available only to
  signed-in guests (`currentHostId` is set); for the host player or a signed-
  out player the command shows a local hint; a dropped signaling WS shows a
  plain error message (the vote wasn't sent). The master additionally only
  accepts votes from a session that actually connected to the room and
  verifies the identity-token — see
  [master.md](master.md#server-rating-likeunlike). The rest of chat goes to
  the host as usual.
- Branches incoming host packets (`handleMessage`) by data type: a string →
  the JSON dispatcher `[portId, payload]` → `socketMethods[portId]`; an
  `ArrayBuffer` → `clientCore.push_frame` (decoding, seq insertion into the
  buffer, and predictor reconciliation all happen in the core; a version
  mismatch drops the frame).
- On `CONFIG_DATA` (port 0) it initializes every module: the PixiJS
  `Application`s, the MVC components, `BakingProvider` (texture baking),
  `SoundManager`, and the **client core** (`ClientPlugin.createClientCore(configJson,
  { wasmUrl })`, where `wasmUrl` is the active game manifest's
  `entries.wasm` — the plugin runs its own wasm-bindgen `init()` and returns
  `{ core, memory }`; the config is assembled by
  [packages/engine/src/lib/clientCoreConfig.js](../../packages/engine/src/lib/clientCoreConfig.js) from the
  `prediction`/`interpolation` sections of CONFIG_DATA); it replies
  `CONFIG_READY`.
- The first frame (`FIRST_SHOT_DATA`, port 4) is applied immediately
  (`applyShot`), bypassing the core.
- **The render loop** `renderTick` on `Ticker.shared` (rAF):
  `clientCore.sample(now)` → reading the flat hot buffer zero-copy from
  WASM memory (tanks/dynamics/camera/predicted tank) + `take_frames()` for
  rare event frames → applied through the previous `parse` pipeline (see
  "Client Core" below).
- Resets: a map change (`MAP_DATA` → `set_map`) and `CLEAR` (→ `reset`)
  clear the frame buffer and the predictor in the core.
- **P2P drop** (`handleDisconnect`): the host leaving kills the room (no
  host migration) — stops the render tick and the `Application`s, shows a
  placeholder, and returns to the lobby by reloading. A terminal close
  reason already shown by the tech informer (a kick, a full room — any code
  but `loading`) isn't overwritten by the generic "Host left…" message; the
  reason is delivered by the host's Worker as a `TECH_INFORM_DATA` message
  right before the channel closes (see
  [network.md](network.md#rtt-pingpong-and-kicks)). `techInformList` has a
  bundle default (`packages/engine/src/config/clientDefaults.js`) — a full-room refusal arrives
  before `CONFIG_DATA`.
- **WebRTC unavailable** (`ensureWebRtcAvailable`): if `RTCPeerConnection`
  is unavailable (Firefox with `media.peerconnection.enabled = false`,
  resist fingerprinting, etc.), `connectToHost`/`connectAsHost` show a
  plain message and stay in the lobby instead of failing with a black
  screen.
- **The host role**: before starting the Worker, `connectAsHost` fetches
  the master's map catalog (falls back to the bundle), registers the room
  and starts a heartbeat once `ready` fires; the host's signaling WS
  reconnects with backoff on a drop
  (`lobbyConfig.reconnect`) and re-registers the room (a fresh `welcome`
  doesn't recreate the lobby — a guard in `initLobby`). A Worker init
  failure (`error`) tears down the room with a message and returns to the
  lobby.

## Network layer (packages/engine/src/client/network/)

The game transport is WebRTC, not WebSocket (channel details —
[network.md](network.md#transport-webrtc)):

- **`SignalingClient`** — a thin wrapper around the master's signaling
  WebSocket: `connect()`, caching `id`/`iceServers` from `welcome`,
  relaying incoming messages to subscribers by `type` (via `Publisher`),
  methods `sendOffer`/`sendIceCandidate`/`pingHost`/`likeHost`/`unlikeHost`.
  The transport is injected by a factory for tests.
- **`WebRtcManager`** — the P2P connection to the host: `RTCPeerConnection`
  + the `meta` (reliable-ordered) and `state` (unreliable-unordered)
  channels. The client is the offerer: it creates the channels/offer,
  exchanges SDP/ICE through `SignalingClient`. `Publisher` events: `open`
  (both channels open), `message` (data from either channel in a single
  stream), `close` (a drop). `RTCPeerConnection` is injected by a factory
  for tests.

The client's role is picked in the lobby (`packages/engine/src/client/main.js`): **joining**
(`connectToHost` → `WebRtcManager`, offerer) or **hosting** (`connectAsHost`
→ a browser host in the same tab). For a host, the game transport is
**`LoopbackTransport`**: the same interface as `WebRtcManager` (`publisher`
with `message`/`close`, `send`/`close`), but data travels through
`HostController` → the Web Worker as postMessages, bypassing WebRTC. Client
code is identical either way — the transport is transparent.

A host tab additionally brings up main-thread routing infrastructure (the
main thread, not the Worker): **`HostController`** spawns the Worker with
the core and bridges it to the transports; **`HostConnectionManager`** is
the **WebRTC answerer** for remote clients (a mirror of `WebRtcManager`):
listens for `webrtc_offer` via `SignalingClient`, creates a
`RTCPeerConnection` per client, catches the `meta`/`state` channels in
`ondatachannel`, sends `webrtc_answer`+ICE, registers the room with the
master (`register_host`/heartbeat), and answers the lobby ping
(`ping_host`). Remote clients' data flows into the same Worker as the host
player's loopback. Details — [host.md](host.md).

There's no classic-Worker fallback (it would forbid ESM and require an
inlined WASM binary — see PLAN.md risk #5), so "Create server" first feature-
detects module-Worker support
(`packages/engine/src/client/network/workerSupport.js`,
`supportsModuleWorker` — a browser only reads a `type` constructor option if
it understands module Workers). On an unsupported browser it shows a plain
"this browser cannot be a host" message and returns without touching
anything else — joining existing rooms is unaffected.

## MVC components (packages/engine/src/client/components/)

Ten `model/` + `view/` + `controller/` triplets: **LobbyAuth**, **Auth**,
**Lobby**, **CanvasManager**, **Controls**, **Game**, **Chat**, **Panel**,
**Stat**, **Vote**.

**LobbyAuth** — the login gate shown before the lobby (`plan/done/central-auth/auth_b2.md`):

- **model** — talks to the central auth service (`packages/auth`, see
  [auth.md](auth.md)) directly, not through the master. `boot(search)` reads
  the OAuth-redirect query string (`?token=`/`?pendingToken=`/`?authError=`)
  once at startup, falling back to a persisted identity JWT in
  `localStorage`; `submitNick` does the one REST call this model makes
  itself (`POST /nick` with the pending token, unlike the signaling-relayed
  I/O other models publish as events) since it's a plain cross-origin fetch,
  not signaling traffic. Publishes `login-required`/`nick-required`/
  `authenticated`/`login-error`/`nick-error`. The identity JWT's payload is
  decoded client-side only for display (`packages/engine/src/lib/jwt.js`,
  `decodeJwtPayload`, no signature check) — a host authoritatively verifies
  it against `/jwks` (`plan/done/central-auth/auth_b3.md`; see
  [auth.md](auth.md#joining-a-room-host-verification)).
- **view** — toggles `#lobby-auth-login`/`#lobby-auth-nick`
  (`views/includes/lobbyAuth.pug`) and, on `authenticated`, hides
  `#lobby-auth` and reveals `#lobby` plus the `#lobby-user` nick/sign-out
  badge (`views/includes/lobby.pug`) — `#lobby` itself starts hidden in the
  template and only `LobbyAuthView` (or `LobbyCtrl.open`) turns it on.
  Provider buttons (`.lobby-auth-provider`, `data-provider`) are filtered
  against the configured provider list.
- **controller** — `login(provider)` navigates the browser
  (`window.location.href = model.loginUrl(provider)`) to the auth service's
  `GET /oauth/:provider/start`; this is a top-level navigation, not a fetch,
  so it isn't subject to CSP `connect-src`. `nick`/`logout` proxy to the
  model.

Config — [packages/engine/src/config/authClient.js](../../packages/engine/src/config/authClient.js)
(bundled into the build like `lobby.js` — `serviceUrl` must point at the
real auth-service domain per deployment; the master's CSP `connect-src`
(`config/master.js`, `security.csp`) is templated with the same
`authServiceUrl` so the lobby's `POST /nick` fetch isn't blocked in
production. `GET /oauth/:provider/start` and the callback redirect are
top-level navigation and unaffected by CSP either way).

**Lobby** — the server-selection screen BEFORE connecting to a host:

- **model** — the server registry (responses from the master's
  `GET /servers`), pagination, search, smart pinging. Does no I/O of its
  own: it publishes `fetch` (request the REST endpoint), `ping-request` (a
  signaling ping), `join` (a server was picked), `list`/`ping-update` (for
  the view). `latency` lives separately from the list and survives a
  refresh/pagination.
- **view** — renders cards, search, "Load more"; **smart pinging** through
  `IntersectionObserver`: a card entering the visible area → `visible` →
  the controller sends `ping_host`; `pong` updates latency and re-sorts
  cards ascending. `IntersectionObserver` is injected for tests. Each card
  also shows the hoster's cached rating (server-rating stage 3 —
  `.lobby-card-rating`, straight from the server object's `rating` field,
  signed for positive values (`+7`/`-3`/`0`); this is engine-level lobby UI,
  not something a game plugin renders.
- **controller** — proxies view events to the model; ping throttling lives
  in the model (`pingHost` returns `false` if the server was pinged
  recently, interval `pingInterval`).

Config — [packages/engine/src/config/lobby.js](../../packages/engine/src/config/lobby.js) (bundled into the
build, since the lobby happens before connecting to a host). The ping
measurement is **approximate** (client→master→host, not P2P RTT) and shown
as such in the UI.

The "Create server" form is **generated** from the keys of the active game
manifest's `roomDefaults` (`populateRoomForm` in `main.js`) — the engine
knows no game-specific fields. The control type is inferred from the
default value: `boolean` → checkbox, `number` → number input, the special
key `map` → a select built from `manifest.maps.list`; the label comes from
the camelCase key (`friendlyFire` → "Friendly fire"). Engine-owned keys get
hints from `lobbyConfig.form`: `secondsKeys` (`roundTime`/`mapTime` are
stored in milliseconds but shown in seconds) and `attrs` (min/max for
number inputs). The game picker (`#lobby-game`) stays hidden while the
master's catalog has a single game. On submit every `roomDefaults` key
(defaults overridden by the form values) is sent as the room object to
`connectAsHost` → `HostController` → the Worker, where `applyRoomOverrides`
(`packages/engine/src/lib/applyRoomOverrides.js`) reads `maxPlayers`/`roundTime`/`mapTime`/
`friendlyFire`/`map`.

The Publisher pattern within a triplet:

- `main.js` or the `view` → calls the `controller`'s methods **directly**;
- the `controller` → calls the `model`'s methods **directly**;
- the `model` → the `view` — **through `Publisher`**
  ([packages/engine/src/lib/Publisher.js](../../packages/engine/src/lib/Publisher.js)): the model publishes
  an event, the view is subscribed; external subscribers can listen to a
  model too.

What each component does:

- **LobbyAuth** — the pre-lobby login gate against the central auth service
  (see above).
- **Auth** — the per-room login form for game-specific fields only (e.g.
  `model`), client-side validation (`validators.js`), localStorage. The nick
  is no longer typed here (Stage B3, see [auth.md](auth.md#joining-a-room-host-verification)):
  `main.js` attaches `LobbyAuthModel.getToken()` to the `AUTH_RESPONSE`
  payload as `token`, and the host verifies it against `/auth/jwks` to
  derive the nick.
- **CanvasManager** — manages several PixiJS `Application`s at once:
  `vimp` (the main game canvas) and `radar` (the mini-map); the canvas
  elements are generated by `main.js` from the game's canvases config
  (`modules.canvasManager.canvases`, including the initial
  `width`/`height`) — they're not in the HTML. Adaptive
  scaling (a 1920px reference width), `aspectRatio`/`fixSize`/`baseScale`,
  a dynamic camera (look-ahead, speed-based zoom), and shake — parameters
  in [configuration.md](configuration.md#modulescanvasmanager--canvases-and-camera).
- **Controls** — keyboard capture (`InputListener`), the active key set
  dictated by the server (port 17), `chat`/`vote`/`stat` modes, input sent
  as `"seq:action:name"`.
- **Game** — the rendering core: `GameCtrl.parse(name, data)` creates/
  updates/removes entity instances from snapshot data through `Factory`.
- **Chat** — message output (row/lifetime limits), the command line;
  escaping happens on output (`textContent`).
- **Panel** — the HUD: round time, health, ammo, active weapon (from
  `'key:value'` strings). `PanelView` **generates the DOM from the game's
  schema** (`modules.panel.fields`: an ordered list of
  `{ name, elem, type }`; cell semantics come from
  `type: 'bar' | 'value' | 'time' | 'weapon'`, not from field names — a
  `bar` field also takes `max` and `blocks`) inside the engine's `#panel`
  container; the cells' look is the game's CSS (bar blocks use the
  engine-neutral `panel-bar-*` classes).
- **Stat** — sortable scoreboard tables (`sortList`), shown on Tab.
  `StatView` **generates the header and tables from the game's schema**
  (`modules.stat.params`: `columns` — column labels, `bodies` — an
  arbitrary number of teams) inside the `#stat` container; team
  colors/labels are the game's CSS.
- **Vote** — vote windows built from templates, pagination, a lifetime
  timer.

## Client Core (ClientCore)

Client-side math — snapshot interpolation, the local tank's prediction,
visual shot spawning, and v3 frame decoding — lives in the Rust core
(`packages/engine/core/src/client/` + the game plugin's own `core/src/client/`,
e.g. `vimp-tanks`'s, the
wasm-bindgen class `ClientCore` from the same WASM
binary as the host's `GameCore`). The JS shell (`main.js`) only forwards
data and applies the result to rendering; ABI and layouts —
[core.md](core.md#clientcore--the-cores-client-mode).

Data flow:

- **Input**: `handleMessage` hands a binary frame to `push_frame(bytes,
  now)` — the core decodes it (a version mismatch drops the frame),
  inserts it into the buffer by `seq` with deduplication, and, if the frame
  carries a player block, reconciles the predictor. Ports
  `MAP_DATA`/`PANEL_DATA`/`KEYSET_DATA`/`CLEAR` mirror into
  `set_map`/`sync_panel`/`set_active`/`reset`; the tank model — `set_model`
  on auth.
- **Render tick**: `sample(now)` returns the length of the flat **hot
  buffer** — `new Float32Array(wasm.memory.buffer, hot_ptr(), len)` read
  zero-copy (the view is recreated every tick: WASM memory growth detaches
  the buffer). The buffer carries flags, the camera (already resolved:
  predicted position or interpolated), interpolated tank/dynamic records,
  and the local tank's predicted record last. The `reconstructHot` adapter
  (~40 lines in `main.js`) assembles the previous shape
  `{ m1: { id: [...] }, c1: {...} }` from it and feeds the existing
  `applyGameData` — GameCtrl/parts were never touched; the predicted record
  overrides the local actor through the same pipeline.
- **Event frames** (the `hasFrames` flag): `take_frames()` returns a JSON
  array `[{ game, camera }, …]` — every crossed `renderTime` frame emitted
  exactly once (events `w1`/`w2e`, creations/removals, camera reset/shake),
  already with duplicate own shots suppressed; applied through the previous
  `applyShot`. Sound and effects trigger as before, from the parts
  themselves on entity creation — there's no separate eventId dispatcher.
- **Input**: `apply_input(action, name, now)` records predictor history;
  game actions go through the `ClientPlugin.hooks.onLocalAction` hook
  (`try_fire(now)` — cooldown/ammo/pending-bomb/alive gates are internal
  to the core — returns spawn JSON for `applyGameData`;
  `nextWeapon`/`prevWeapon` — `cycle_weapon`). Sending `"seq:action:name"`
  to the host is unchanged.

**The game's ClientPlugin** (the game plugin's `src/client/index.js`, e.g.
`vimp-tanks`'s; loaded dynamically by the engine from the master's
`GameManifest`, stage 6.3 —
`packages/engine/src/lib/gamePlugin.js`) supplies `parts` (entity renderers),
`bakers` (procedural textures), the game CSS and the hooks. The core's game
methods are called only from its hooks — `onAuth` (`set_model` on auth), `onPanel` (`sync_panel`
per panel frame), `onLocalAction` (e.g. `try_fire`/`cycle_weapon` in
`vimp-tanks`); `main.js` doesn't know the core's game methods. The game's
CSS (panel cells, canvases, team colors) is the game plugin's own
`src/client/*.css` (e.g. `vimp-tanks`'s `tanks.css`); the engine UI skeleton
is `packages/engine/src/client/style.css`.

Internally the core implements the following algorithms:

- **interpolation** (`client/interpolator.rs`): an EMA offset of server
  time, `renderTime = serverNow − delay` (config `interpolation.delay: 100`
  ms), lerp for actors/dynamics/camera (angles by shortest path), discrete
  fields taken from the reference frame, hold with no extrapolation,
  seq-based insertion + immediate emission of late-frame events;
- **prediction** (`client/predictor.rs`): a replica of the authoritative
  motion without Rapier collisions, at a fixed `timeStep`; tick formulas
  are **shared** with the game plugin's own actor-update code (e.g.
  `vimp-tanks`'s `core/src/motion.rs`) — the replica
  can't diverge from the authoritative path on formulas, integration
  parity (manual vs. Rapier) is locked in by the `client_parity` cargo
  tests; input history, replay from the frame's `serverTime`,
  `visualError` with exponential decay and a snap, freeze at `condition
  0`, resets on a camera forceReset/map change/keySet;
- **shot spawning** (`client/shot.rs` + `client/raycast.rs`): a replica of
  the authoritative gate and muzzle formulas, DDA raycasting over wall
  tiles + an OBB test against dynamics and actors, a single
  pending-projectile gate, RTT-compensated projectile position,
  suppressing authoritative duplicates by author id (a FIFO queue with a
  timeout, local keys `L<n>`) — field names and exact gating are
  game-defined (e.g. `vimp-tanks`'s `tracers`/`bombs` entity blocks, see
  [network.md](network.md)). Any client-side-only visual randomness (e.g.
  tracer spread) is a purely visual effect — the authoritative entity
  arrives in a frame.

## Rendering

### parts/ — entities

The game plugin's own `src/client/parts/` (e.g. [`vimp-tanks`'s](https://github.com/lgick/vimp-tanks/tree/main/src/client/parts)) —
classes rendered on the PixiJS canvases, one per game entity type (e.g.
`vimp-tanks`'s `Tank`, `TankRadar`, `Map`, `MapRadar`, `Bomb`, `Smoke`,
`Tracks`). Effects follow the same plugin-owned convention (e.g.
`vimp-tanks`'s `parts/effects/`), animated on `Ticker.shared`.

Mapping snapshot keys to classes, and their canvas assignment, is
`gameSets`/`entitiesOnCanvas` in `client.js`. There's no fixed contract for
a part — use the existing ones as a template when creating a new one.

### Factory

[packages/engine/src/lib/factory.js](../../packages/engine/src/lib/factory.js) — an entity-name → class
registry. `GameCtrl.parse(name, data)` creates an instance from incoming
data, calls `update(data)` on an existing one, or removes it (`null`).

### Providers

- **`BakingProvider`**
  ([providers/BakingProvider.js](../../packages/engine/src/client/providers/BakingProvider.js))
  — one-time procedural texture generation at startup from the
  `bakedAssets` config; baking functions live in
  [the game plugin's `src/client/bakers/`](https://github.com/lgick/vimp-tanks/tree/main/src/client/bakers) (e.g. `vimp-tanks`'s; no fixed
  interface, follow the existing ones).
- **`DependencyProvider`** — injects services (`renderer`, `soundManager`)
  into components via the `componentDependencies` map.

## SoundManager

[packages/engine/src/client/SoundManager.js](../../packages/engine/src/client/SoundManager.js) (built on
Howler.js). Sounds are described in the game plugin's `src/config/sounds.js`
(e.g. `vimp-tanks`'s); its
`path` field is overridden client-side (`main.js`, `CONFIG_DATA` handler) to
`${activeGameManifest.assetsBase}sounds/` — the game build's own sound copy
served alongside its client/host bundles (the game plugin's `dist/sounds/`),
rather than the engine-bundled `/sounds/` static copy.

- **UI/system** (no position): `playSystemSound(name)` — plays instantly,
  bypassing priorities (also used for port 6 sounds).
- **Spatial** (positioned in the world): `registerSound(name, { position
  })` → `processAudibility()` → `updateActiveSounds()` — the manager
  decides what's audible on its own, honoring a voice limit
  (`WORLD_VOICE_LIMIT = 30`) and priorities from the config.

## InputListener

[packages/engine/src/client/InputListener.js](../../packages/engine/src/client/InputListener.js) — low-level
keydown/keyup capture for Controls; `modes`/`cmds` take priority over the
game key set.

## UI hierarchy (z-index)

`vimp` (1) → `radar` (2) → `chat` (3) → `panel` (4) → `vote` (5) →
`game-informer` (6) → `stat` (7) → `lobby`/`auth` (8) → `tech-informer` (9).
The lobby (`#lobby`, z-index 8) is the starting server-selection screen,
shown before connecting to a host and hidden once the game starts.
