//   vite build --mode client|host

//                     (PixiJS) into the Worker-safe host bundle.

// PixiJS is a singleton supplied by the engine through an import map, so it
// stays external in the builds and deduped in dev — two PixiJS copies mean
// two extension registries, and objects of one copy fail inside the other.
